Now then, One last thing I need to show you.
Now, you may notice something new, on your right.
When heroes come back from their quests, they'll present a report!
All you have to do is file those reports in the green bin on your right, like a normal quest.
When you do, you'll get your portion of the commission, and the heroes get paid! Celebrations all around.
Anyway, I think you can take it from here, so i'll let you get to work. See you later!
