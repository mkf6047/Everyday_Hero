Now then, One last thing I need to show you.
When heroes come back from their quests, or need help, they'll send a report!
Completed quests get a red stamp, while those who need help get a blue stamp.
Now, you may notice something new, on your right.
All you have to do is file the red reports in the green bin on your right, like a normal quest.
When you do, you'll get your portion of the commission, and the heroes get paid! Celebrations all around.
The blue stamped reports can be treated like a normal quest. Pass them along to a present hero, and they'll go help!
Or, dispose of the quest. This will bring the hero back, so you can assign them new quests tomorrow.
Anyway, I think you can take it from here, so i'll let you get to work. See you later!
